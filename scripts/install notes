# Installation Guide for Read Generation and Processing Scripts

This guide covers the installation of all necessary tools and software for running the read generation script and the FastP processing script.

## 1. Basic System Requirements

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS)
- Bash shell
- Internet connection for downloading packages

## 2. Package Managers

Ensure you have one of the following package managers installed:

- apt (for Ubuntu/Debian)
- brew (for macOS)
- conda (for any OS, recommended for easy management of bioinformatics tools)

## 3. Required Software

### For the Read Generation Script:

1. **InSilicoSeq (iss)**
   ```
   pip install InSilicoSeq
   ```

2. **R**
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install r-base`
   - macOS: `brew install r`

3. **gzip** (usually pre-installed on most Unix-like systems)

### For the FastP Processing Script:

1. **FastP**
   - Using conda: `conda install -c bioconda fastp`
   - Or follow installation instructions at: https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp

2. **GNU Parallel**
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install parallel`
   - macOS: `brew install parallel`

## 4. Additional R Packages

If your `create_library.R` script requires specific R packages, install them within R:

```R
install.packages(c("package1", "package2"))
```

Replace "package1", "package2", etc., with the actual package names.

## 5. Trimmomatic Adapters

Download Trimmomatic adapters:

```bash
wget http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/Trimmomatic-0.39.zip
unzip Trimmomatic-0.39.zip
```

The NexteraPE-PE.fa file will be in the `Trimmomatic-0.39/adapters/` directory.

## 6. Verify Installations

After installing, verify each tool is correctly installed and accessible:

```bash
iss --version
R --version
fastp --version
parallel --version
```

Each command should return version information without errors.

## Note

Ensure all installed tools are in your system's PATH. You may need to log out and log back in or restart your terminal for PATH changes to take effect.

If you encounter any issues during installation or execution of the scripts, please refer to the official documentation of each tool for troubleshooting.
